Our group created a one-stop resource for users to locate and select meal plans of their dietary preference, with the same ease and efficiency as your standard take-out app. Not only does Nutri-Prep provide instant daily meal plans, but it simultaneously offers the corresponding ingredients, recipe, and nutrition details. 

Using two APIs (Spoonacular and CockTail DB) we were able to create an app that allows users to search for meals by caloric intake, as well as nutritional ‘goals’.  The app provides three randomly generated meals that together, meet the daily calorie number the user provided. 

The user can easily view the recipe, nutrition facts, and rate the site once complete.
